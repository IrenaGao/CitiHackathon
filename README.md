# CitiHackathon

Must have all packages installed for Python Flask, React, and Data Science algorithms.

Front-end: cd into app and run npm install in terminal to create node_modules. Then run npm start.

Back-end: while the front-end is still running, cd into recommend_utensil_store and run export FLASK_APP=main.py. Then run python -m flask run.

(Note: in the recommend_utensil_store folder, there needs to be a dataset added called yelp_academic_dataset_business.json. It can be found on this link (https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset?fbclid=IwAR3dq7djN5J95j24_Pi8fCoixwfsvOG8xMJxWKuP8tCgeWVZvi71wDbn8wM&select=yelp_academic_dataset_business.json) and downloaded.)

When app starts running start on /InterestForm in the URL.
